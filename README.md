# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
# Project #1: Boston Housing Prices

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Machine-Learning Nanodegree. It uses supervised learning algorithms to generate a model for housing prices based on data collected in Boston in 1978.


## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Regression algorithms like Decision Tree Regressor
  - Evaluation metrics like r2 score
  - Cross validation
  - Parameter optimization using grid search
  - Identifying overfitted and underfitted models

Relevant Classes:
